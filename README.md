# Sentimental-Analysis-LSTM
This project is designed to explore various algorithms and test which algorithm can better deal with context.
The Algorithms explored are :
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Random Forest
4. XgBoost
5. Long-Short Term Memory NN (LSTM)

The embeddings on which the algorithms was tested :
1. Bag of Words
2. TfidfVectorizer
3. Word2Vector

Conclusion : Xgboost with word2vec outperformed every algorithm and technique. But if we can have more data LSTM might perform better.
